termios.tcgetattr(fd)

    Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor fd, as follows: [iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc] where cc is a list of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the items with indices VMIN and VTIME, which are integers when these fields are defined). The interpretation of the flags and the speeds as well as the indexing in the cc array must be done using the symbolic constants defined in the termios module.


ECHO in c_lflag controls whether input is immediately re-echoed as output. It is independent of ICANON, although they are often turned on and off together. When passwd prompts for your password, your terminal is in canonical mode, but ECHO is disabled.
